### Background

I used to have another blog site on a wordpress like platform.
One of my favorite features that the site had was an image carousel, where I could put a number of 
photos with captions. It made it really easy to share a collection of photos and add context to a post.

Now with this site, I am able to already put single images into posts in regular markdown format.
This however does not satisfy what I want to do. Fortunately, with astro and **.mdx** file extension,
I can place Astro components directly into these posts all while mostly keeping the syntax in markdown.
