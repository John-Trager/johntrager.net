## Why Astro

This is my first post on this site, and I am excited to share how I set it up using Astro.
I chose Astro because it allows me to build fast, modern websites with a focus on performance and user experience.
The framework's component-based architecture makes it easy to manage and scale the site as needed.

I started the site using the [Astro-Nano template](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano).
It provided a great start with a clean minimal design, and with most of the features that I was 
looking for.

Some of these features include:
- using tailwind for styling
- a simple blog / project system
- dark/light mode
- a clean and minimal design
- lightweight (full CSR) and optimized for SEO

## Hosting Setup
My domain was purchased though cloudflare, but I am not using their static page hosting.
I am instead using github pages to host the site as it seemed to make the deployment process
much more straightforward, push to the repo and in about a minute the changes are on the site.
